Project Overview
================

This project helps you to generate 2D terrains, that are matrix of integers, with a point of origin and a point of destination.
Over these terrains you have several features:

- You can print it in the console
- You can plot it in a ``matplotlib`` 2D plot
- You can plot it in 3D with different angles
- **You can check the total length of a given path from origin to destination**
- You can even draw the paths in the plots previously mentioned


============
Installation
============

Just use the following command in your notebook:

.. code-block:: py

    !pip install git+https://github.com/jparisu/sIArena.git

Check the :ref:`installation guide <installation>` for more details.
